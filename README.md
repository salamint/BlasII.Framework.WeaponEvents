# Blasphemous II weapon events framework

This mod is a framework that allows other mods to very easily handle events
generated by the player when attacking with any weapon.

This framework contains:
- Abstract handler classes, which you can inherit to handle all the events
related to a weapon.
- Event IDs enumerations, as well as an enumeration for weapon IDs, and a few
constants.

## Dependencies

- [Modding API](https://github.com/Damocles/BlasII.ModdingAPI)

## Structure

This mod's source code is separated in multiple namespaces:
- The `Constants` namespace, which contains all the enumerations and other
constants that are used by the framework, but you could use it in your own mod.
- The `Events` namespace, which contains the main feeature of the framework: the
  abstract event handler classes (see [Usage](#usage)).
- The `HandlersManagers` namespace, which contains classes used internally by
the framework, and you won't ever need to use.
- The `Patches` namespace, which you won't ever need to use, as it only contains
  classes used to patch the game's methods.

## Usage

### Example

```cs
using BlasII.Framework.WeaponEvents.Events;
using BlasII.ModdingAPI;

namespace BlasII.MyOwnMod;

/// <summary>
/// This is an example of how you can use this framework, to display a message
/// in the console everytime the player gains an indicator while wielding
/// Sarmiento y Centella.
/// </summary>
public class MyCustomRapier : RapierHandler
{
    /// <summary>
    /// This is all the code you need, now simply add the framework in your
    /// dependencies, compile your mod and run the game.
    /// </summary>
	protected override void OnIndicator(int tier)
    {
        ModLog.Debug($"Indicator gained! Current indicator level: {tier}");
    }
}
```
